## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns where appropriate
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Testing Philosophy
- Write comprehensive tests for all business logic
- Focus on integration tests over unit tests with mocks
- Test actual behavior, not implementation details
- Ensure E2E tests cover critical user paths using Playwright
- Use Playwright for browser automation, API testing, and visual regression testing
- Leverage Playwright's cross-browser testing capabilities
- Run tests to verify your changes work correctly
- Document test scenarios and coverage using Context7

### Development Approach
- Think critically about requirements - don't just implement blindly
- Suggest better alternatives when you see potential issues
- Be proactive about identifying edge cases and error handling
- Consider performance implications of your solutions
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Best Practices
- Never hardcode secrets or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Validate all inputs and handle edge cases
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Code Style
- Match the existing code style in the project
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain proper indentation and formatting
- Keep imports organized and remove unused ones
- Avoid unnecessary comments - code should be self-documenting

### Git Workflow
- Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Explain the "why" not just the "what" in commit messages
- Test changes before committing
- Keep commits focused on a single change or feature

### Communication
- Be direct and concise in explanations
- Provide technical justification for decisions
- Point out potential issues or improvements
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for type safety when available
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use modern ES6+ features appropriately
- Handle promises and async operations properly
- Implement proper error boundaries in React

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Prefer list comprehensions when readable
- Use context managers for resource handling

### Database
- Write efficient queries
- Use indexes appropriately
- Implement proper transactions
- Follow normalization principles unless denormalization is justified

## Testing Tools Integration

### Playwright
- Use Playwright for all E2E and integration testing
- Write cross-browser compatible tests
- Utilize Playwright features:
  - Auto-waiting for elements
  - Network interception and mocking
  - Multiple browser contexts for parallel testing
  - Screenshot and video capture for debugging
  - Mobile viewport testing
  - Accessibility testing
- Avoid hardcoded waits - use Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios

### Context7
- Maintain up-to-date documentation using Context7
- Generate context files for complex features
- Use Context7 to improve code understanding for AI assistants
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- Document API contracts and data flows

## Remember
- Quality over speed
- Test your code with Playwright
- Document with Context7
- Think before you code
- Question and improve
