Cursor Rules â€“ Codex Notes

- Source of truth: `.cursorrules` at repo root.
- Mirror for Codex: `.codex/CURSOR_RULES.md` to keep all Codex-facing mirrors in one place.
- Intent: identical guidance (quality, testing, security, Git workflow) made discoverable for Codex users.
- Use with: `.codex/CODEX_RULES.md` (Claude rules mirror) when working in Codex CLI.

Change management
- Update `.cursorrules` first; keep `.codex/CURSOR_RULES.md` in sync via small diffs.
- Avoid large duplication beyond these mirrors to reduce drift.
